**A beginner’s guide to learning and implementing Amazon EMR for building data analytics solutions**

## What is this book about?
Amazon EMR, formerly Amazon Elastic MapReduce, provides a managed Hadoop cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that you can use to implement batch or streaming data pipelines. 
By gaining expertise in Amazon EMR, you can design and implement data analytics pipelines with persistent or transient EMR clusters in AWS.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore Amazon EMR features, architecture, Hadoop interfaces, and EMR Studio
* Configure, deploy, and orchestrate Hadoop or Spark jobs in production
* Implement the security, data governance, and monitoring capabilities of EMR
* Build applications for batch and real-time streaming data analytics solutions
* Perform interactive development with a persistent EMR cluster and Notebook
* Orchestrate an EMR Spark job using AWS Step Functions and Apache Airflow
